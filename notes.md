# Project Development Memo

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and scalable machine learning API that predicts diamond prices based on their features. This endeavor seeks to blend comprehensive ML pipeline management, detailed preprocessing, and production-ready API.

## Main aspects to cover:

- **Data Management:** Utilize a detailed data preprocessing approach aligning input data and model.
- **Model Training:** Explore advanced ML models, considering model performance and efficiency. Emphasis on evaluation metrics.
- **API Development:** Develop a Flask API with comprehensive endpoint management. The API will serve as the interface for model predictions.
- **Containerization:** Implement application containerization, generally aim for consistency in development and deployment environments. Envision Cloud integration.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and concise documentation to ensure ease of use and reproducibility.


## How to Use the Diamond Price Prediction Application

### Accessing the Web Application

1. Navigate to [Web App URL] in your web browser.
2. Fill in the required fields with the diamond's characteristics (e.g., carat, cut, color, clarity, etc.).
3. Click the "Predict" button to submit the information.
4. You will receive an estimated price for the diamond based on the input features.

### Running Locally

If you'd like to run the application locally, ensure you have Docker installed, then:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t diamond-price-predictor .`
3. Run the container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 diamond-price-predictor`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
