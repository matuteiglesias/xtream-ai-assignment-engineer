# Project Development Memo

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and scalable machine learning API that predicts diamond prices based on their features. This endeavor seeks to blend comprehensive ML pipeline management, detailed preprocessing, and production-ready API.

## Main aspects to cover:

- **Data Management:** Utilize a detailed data preprocessing approach aligning input data and model.
- **Model Training:** Explore advanced ML models, considering model performance and efficiency. Emphasis on evaluation metrics.
- **API Development:** Develop a Flask API with comprehensive endpoint management. The API will serve as the interface for model predictions.
- **Containerization:** Implement application containerization, generally aim for consistency in development and deployment environments. Envision Cloud integration.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and concise documentation to ensure ease of use and reproducibility.
